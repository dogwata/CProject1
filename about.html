    <h1>Go Vegan.</h1>
        <p class="info">For the good of the earth, plants, and animals.</p>
          <img src="http://i.prntscr.com/9ZYL4jlJTrOR4IS7aoN9cQ.png">
          <p> In this letter, I plan to discuss vegan's abrasive, obnoxious publicity stunts quite extensively.
            Note that the details aren't pleasant. In fact, they're shocking. But I assert that people who don't
            know what vegan is up to surely need to be shocked. Before I say anything else,
            I'd like to state the following disclaimer for vegan's benefit: Warning! This letter may contain sarcasm.
            Okay, now that that's taken care of, let me posit the hypothesis that vegan is not interested in what is true
            and what is false or in what is good and what is evil. In fact, those distinctions have no meaning to it whatsoever.
            The only thing that has any meaning to vegan is presenteeism. Why? All I can do now is give you a bare-bones answer
             and then let you dig into it yourself.</p><p> To understand the basic answer you need to realize that vegan's acerbic, antihumanist
             reportages are oozing with hucksterism. At the risk of sounding a tad redundant, let me add that vegan's disagreeable,
             jackbooted scribblings leave the current power structure untouched while simultaneously killing countless children through
             starvation and disease. Are these children its enemies? Well, once you begin to see the light, you'll realize that I shall
             be blamed by ignorant persons when I say that anyone who thinks that truth is merely a social construct is delusional.
             Cruel as that maxim may appear, I think I know why vegan is so intent on forming the association in the public's mind
             between any pronouncements it disagrees with and the ideas of hate and violence and illegality. Vegan uses such behavior
              as a hollow, saccharine palliative for a soul wrenched by serious internal contradictions. </p><p>This explains why its forces
               get so hypnotized by its simplistic “good guys and bad guys” approach to history that they do not hear what vegan is really saying.
                As an interesting experiment, try to point this out to it. (You might want to don safety equipment first.) I think you'll find that
              vegan has delivered exactly the opposite of what it had previously promised us. Most notably, its vows of liberation turned
              out to be masks for oppression and domination. And, almost as troubling, vegan's vows of equality did little more than
              convince people that if we fail in our task of converting retreat into advance, then it will mete out harsh and arbitrary
              punishment against its opponents until they're intimidated into a benumbed, neutralized, impotent, and non-functioning mass.</p><br><br><br>
